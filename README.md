DESCRIPTION: Overview
This webpage is a simple chatbot interface that allows users to type and send messages, and get predefined responses from the chatbot. It looks clean, modern, and is designed to be user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices. The chatbot works fully in the browser without requiring any internet connection or server.

DESIGN AND LAYOUT:

The background is a soft gradient with calm colors to create a pleasant visual feel.
The chat area is placed in the center of the screen with a white card-style container.

THE CHAT BOX INCLUDES:

A header that says "Simple Chatbot"
A message area that shows all conversation messages
A text input box where the user can type messages
A send button to submit the message

CHAT FUNCTIONALITY:

When a user types a message and hits Send (or presses Enter), the message appears on the right side of the chat box.
After a short delay, the chatbot automatically replies with a matching response based on keywords in the user’s message.
Messages are visually styled like chat bubbles, with:
Blue messages on the right for the user
Green messages on the left for the bot

BOT RESPONSES:

The chatbot gives basic responses based on what the user types. For example:
If you say “hello”, it will reply with “Hi there! ”
If you ask “how are you?”, it will respond “I’m just a bot, but doing great! ”
If you ask “what's your name?”, it tells you it's a simple chatbot.
If you say “bye”, it says goodbye back.
If it doesn’t understand your message, it shows a default response saying it didn't understand.

USER EXPERIENCE:

It automatically scrolls to show the latest messages.
The input area and button are styled for easy typing and clicking.
The chat interface is responsive, so it adjusts well on different screen sizes.

IN SUMMARY:

Fully browser-based chatbot
Stylish and easy-to-use design
Basic auto-reply system with keyword matching
No backend or internet needed
Great starting point for building more advanced chat applications
